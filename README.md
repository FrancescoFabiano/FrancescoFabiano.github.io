# About

My personal website built with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

# Dependencies

- [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com) mostly for the grid
- [Font Awesome 5](https://fontawesome.com/) for social icons
- jQuery & Popper for forked components (my own components are written in vanilla js)
- [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) and [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for the incoming blog

# Theme

**Color Scheme:** Terminology

![terminology](https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/website23-1024x512.jpg)

**Font:** [Roboto Slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab) by Christian Robertson

# Forking

This repo is under the MIT License, you can use any of its components

I have forked the following components from [CodePen](https://codepen.io/),
you want to use them please also give them credit.
- **Accordeon:** Javascript from [Accordeon](https://codepen.io/axelf/pen/jPNmYP) by Alex @axelf
- **Tabs:** SCSS from [Tabs Vertical Dark](https://codepen.io/bchiang7/pen/mjzMbj) Brittany Chiang @bchiang7

Also, I'm pretty proud of my SVG Fourier animation,
I did it with [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/) to optimize its speed,
so please give me credit if you use it in your work.
I'm probably going to open up a repo for it.
