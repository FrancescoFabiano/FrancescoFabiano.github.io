# About

My personal website built with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

# Dependencies

- ~~[Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com) mostly for the grid~~
  Implemented my own responsive design (which is continuous unlike Bootstrap's grid).
- ~~[Font Awesome 5](https://fontawesome.com/) for social icons~~
  Using GitHub's [Feather SVG Icons](https://feathericons.com/) which loads faster.
- ~~jQuery & Popper for forked components (my own components are written in vanilla js)~~
  Reimplemented those components in pure Javascript.
- ~~[highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) and [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/)
  for the incoming blog~~ I'd rather import it for the blog subdomain when it comes.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/): I think I'm going to keep it for now.

No more bloated dependencies, performance is better, and I have more control.
*I am big boy now.*

Also, I'm pretty proud of my SVG Fourier animation,
