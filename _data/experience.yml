    I contributed to the [Mind the Gap!](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010448518302215)
    algorithm developped by [Pixel team](https://pixel.inria.fr) that proposes a robust pipeline
    for generating hexahedral-dominant meshes from any global parametrization of a tetrahedral mesh.
    
    I proposed and implemented improvements to the pipeline that helped obtain better meshes with
    less irregularities.
