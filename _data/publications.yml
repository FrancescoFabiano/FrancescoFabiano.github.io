    The reconstruction mechanisms built by the human auditory system during
    sound reconstruction are still a matter of debate.
    The purpose of this study is to refine the auditory cortex model introduced in [9],
    and inspired by the geometrical modelling of vision.
    The algorithm transforms the degraded sound in an 'image' in the time-frequency domain
    via a short-time Fourier transform. Such an image is then lifted in the Heisenberg group
    and it is reconstructed via a Wilson-Cowan differo-integral equation.
    Numerical experiments on a library of speech recordings are provided,
    showing the good reconstruction properties of the algorithm.
