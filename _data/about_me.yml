    Learning maths is like winning new pieces of a great puzzle.
    When I learn a new elegant math concept, I reformulate it nicely on
    a math notebook I've had since high school.

- head: I love coding
  body: >-
    Ever since I've started learning `logo`, I loved the idea of making programs
    that can actually do things from simple instructions.
    I also appreciate a clean piece of code just as much as one can appreciate art,
    which is why I try to keep my code as modular and optimal as possible.

- head: I love learning and sharing knowledge
  body: >-
    I enjoy learning about new subjcts or new approaches of defining well-established concepts,
    I always end up with a better understanding of the subject and digging up even more.
    In such situations I'm always driven into sharing that with colleages sharing that interest.

- head: I like ricing
  body: >-
    I have spent countless hours ricing my Arch Linux and my i3 environment.
    It's a world I have discovered in the last couple of years.

- head: I love music
  body: >-
    Music plays a big part of my life, I like various music genres,
    but I mostly like to play music at the orchestra.
