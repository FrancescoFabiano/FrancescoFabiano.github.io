    I am currently working on this project for my Masters thesis.

    The project is a state of the art of pitch and onset detection
    algorithms in music signals, and a python library
    that provides an API for the presented algorithms,
    as well as a proposed scale detection algorithm.

    I implemented the famous sliding tiles game in Prolog using A* graph search algorithm
    for NÃ—M sized puzzles.

    I also implemented a greedy algorithm and Iterative Deepening Depth-First-Search,
    and compared the performance and results of the algorithms.

    I implemented an *AsciiMath to LaTeX* interpretor using [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/).
    This project was part of the course *lexical and syntaxical analysis* in my INSA Master's program.

    AsciiMath is a markup language that represents a subset of mathematical expressions using
    simple readable ASCII syntax unlike LaTeX or MathJax.
    AsciiMath is to TeX Math what Markdown is to LaTeX.

    I implemented mathematical operations for floating-point numbers (IEEE 765 standard)
    through bitwise operations in C++ using Newton's Algorithm, CORDIC and others.
    
    Having learned the floating numbers machine representation and implemented
    the square root function as an assignment for a course in computer-based calculations,
    I was compelled to extend the assignment to other mathematical operations.
