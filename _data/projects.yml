    I have suggested this project as my Masterâ€™s program semestrial project.
    The objective is to implement a library that converts audio files into a musical score.
    The program implements onset and pitch detection algorithms,
    and improves obtained results with machine learning algorithms.

    I implemented an *AsciiMath to LaTeX* interpretor using [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/).
    This project was part of the course *lexical and syntaxical analysis* in my INSA Master's program.

    AsciiMath is a markup language that represents a subset of mathematical expressions using
    simple readable ASCII syntax unlike LaTeX or MathJax.
    AsciiMath is to TeX Math what Markdown is to LaTeX.

    I implemented mathematical operations for floating-point numbers (IEEE 765 standard)
    through bitwise operations in C++ using Newton's Algorithm, CORDIC and others.
    
    Having learned the floating numbers machine representation and implemented
    the square root function as an assignment for a course in computer-based calculations,
    I was compelled to extend the assignment to other mathematical operations.
