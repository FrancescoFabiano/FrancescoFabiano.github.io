    I have suggested this project as my Masterâ€™s program semestrial project.
    The objective is to implement a library that converts audio files into a musical score.
    The program implements onset and pitch detection algorithms,
    and improves obtained results with machine learning algorithms.

    I implemented an *AsciiMath to LaTeX* interpretor using [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/).
    This project was part of the course *lexical and syntaxical analysis* in my INSA Master's program.

    AsciiMath is a markup language that represents a subset of mathematical expressions using
    simple readable ASCII syntax unlike LaTeX or MathJax.
    AsciiMath is to TeX Math what Markdown is to LaTeX.

    The project aims to minimize the loss of produced energyby proposing a new decentralized storage solution.
    My role in NORIAS is to maximize the efficiency of thestorage station by creating and managing a control systembased on ICT and IoT,
    coupled with mathematical analysisand big data algorithms.

  long_title: Floating-point Arithmatics
  date: April 2016
  description: >-
    I implemented mathematical operations for floating-point numbers (IEEE 765 standard)
    through bitwise operations in C++ using Newton's Algorithm, CORDIC and others.
    
    Having learned the floating numbers machine representation and implemented
    the square root function as an assignment for a course in computer-based calculations,
    I was compelled to extend the assignment to other mathematical operations.
